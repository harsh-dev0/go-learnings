Welcome to the Go Learning Project! This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress as I learn the Go programming language.

## Overview

This project contains various resources, exercises, and projects that I will be working on throughout my learning journey.

## Structure

- **src/basics**: Contains basic Go programs to help understand the fundamentals of the language.
- **src/exercises**: Documentation of exercises completed during the learning process.
